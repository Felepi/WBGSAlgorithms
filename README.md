<h1>WBGS Algorithms</h1>
<h3>A project for programming practice</h3>
<h5>By Hamish Starling (and you!)</h5>
<p>During the holidays this year, there are two important skills that we can work on as future A Level Computing Students, and these can be worked on simultaneously in a fun way.</p>
<p>Namely, these are: 
<ul>
<li>Algorithm Knowledge - A wider understanding of the different algorithms out there.</li>
<li>Programming Skills - A programmer is only as versatile as the number of languages he is familiar with.</li>
</ul>
For this reason, I am proposing a project to practice our programming for 10-20 mins every day until we go back to school:
<ol>
<li>Each person who wishes to participate, and I stress that this is completely optional, will choose a programming language, ideally one that they are learning but you can do one you know already. If two people choose the same language, that is fine. I am choosing C.</li>
<li>Each day I will choose an algorithm to implement, and I will produce some C code to implement that algorithm</li>
<li>Then, all other participants will produce a program implementing the same algorithm in their chosen language, if they are not busy.</li>
<li>They can test their program using some tests which I will publish on the challenge page</li>
<li>And then they can make a pull request to upload their code to the repository, or email me it and I will add it myself if you are not familiar with GitHub.</li>
<li>Anyone who uploads code will then be featured on the repository, and at the end of the project I will choose some of my favourite implementations to highlight in some kind of installtion, probably at Open Day.</li>
<li>Don't forget that by participating you will also perceive the inestimable benefit of an improved knowledge of your chosen programming language.</li>
</ol>
Hopefully this will be a fun way to practice programming and learn about some new algorithms.
The first few algorithms will be something like: (starting easy with some that we know from GCSE)
<ul>
<li>Linear Search</li>
<li>Binary Search</li>
<li>Bubble Sort</li>
<li>Merge Sort</li>
<li>Euclidean Algorithm</li>
<li>A Level search and sort alg.s such as Insertion sort</li>
</ul>
And then we will go "off-piste" and pick some random ones that I find online that sound interesting and useful. I may flex the order if it gets too boring.
Any contributions, no matter what language or algorithm are welcome.
If you have any suggestions for algorithms, send me an email and I will pop it into the schedule.
If you are interested in participating, don't feel obliged to do this, but it would be helpful if you could file an Issue on the GitHub page to let me know you are interested or Watch the repository from the top right corner.

The project will start next Monday 13th July. 

NB: This might make a good way to practise your JS if you are doing the Code Academy JS as Dr Hedges Suggested
NB: If you have missed the start of the project, don't worry. You can join at any stage either by catching up or joining in at the given time.
